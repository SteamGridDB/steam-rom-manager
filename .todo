# Notes
To update all the config presets at once:

1) Make a modifier in `src/renderer/modifiers/config-presets.modifier.ts` to make the desired change to the preset files
2) Add the current app version and current app commit (or any commit before presets change) to `files/presetsHashes.json`
3) Run `npm run update-files` and ensure the new presets validate (validation comes from the user-configuration schema)
4) Commit changes and `git push`

# Fixes
