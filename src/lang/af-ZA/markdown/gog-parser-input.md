# Unique inputs for GOG Galaxy Parser

## Galaxy Path Override
By default Steam ROM Manager assumes your Galaxy Client is located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe`. This field allows you to override that path if your GOG Galaxy installation is elsewhere.

This field is actually only necessary if you enable launch via GOG Galaxy (see below), as otherwise SRM has no need of the location of the Galaxy Client.
