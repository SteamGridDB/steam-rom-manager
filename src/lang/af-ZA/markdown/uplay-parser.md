# UPlay Parser

This parser imports games from `UPlay` (also known as `Ubisoft Connect`) so that artwork can be chosen for them and they can be added into Steam. If it doesn't work it is most likely because Ubisoft has altered the structure of their game database, in this case please let the developers of SRM know and we will resolve the issue.

## Compatibility

This parser is currently functional on `Windows` systems only.
