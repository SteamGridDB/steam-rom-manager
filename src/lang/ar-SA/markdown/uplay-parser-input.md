# UPlay Parser Specific Inputs

## Ubisoft Directory Override
By default Steam ROM Manager assumes your UPlay install is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft`. This field allows you to override that path if your UPlay installation is elsewhere.

## Launch Via UPlay `[Recommend disabled]`
What it sounds like, this toggle let's you set whether games will launch via UPlay or directly from the game's executable.

For UPlay this doesn't matter too much as UPlay games will automatically launch UPlay in the background even when launched from the executable. Steam Overlay will not work when `Launch via UPlay` is enabled, whereas both Steam and Ubisoft overlays work when `Launch via UPlay` is disabled.
