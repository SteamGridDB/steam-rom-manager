# Local icons (optional) `[supports variables]`{.noWrap}

Allows one to set icons stored locally. A [special glob input](#special-glob-input) string is used to retrieve images.

## Preview shows some kind of eye icon

This icon is shown for files, that SRM can not display as icons (for example `EXE` files). It does not mean that those files are invalid and will probably be displayed properly by Steam.

## Can you move the directory of local icon after saving app list?

No. No. Steam does not support relative paths for icons, therefore there is no point in copying icons to Steam directory.
