# Epic Games Store Specific Inputs

## Manifests Directory Override

Most users shouldn't use this, as they use the standard `Epic Games Store` installation where the game manifests will be located in, for example on Windows, `C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests`. 

If, however, for some reason your manifests directory is located in a non-typical location then you can specify the correct manifests directory here.

## Launch Via Epic Games Store `[Recommend enabled]`

This toggle lets you set whether games will launch via the Epic Games Store or directly. If you don't launch via the `Epic Games Store` you will not have access to Epic's online services in game.
