# Legendary Parser

This parser imports games from [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary), the open source commandline alternative to the `Epic Games Store`, so that artwork can be chosen for them and they can be added into Steam. 

If it doesn't work it is because has altered the structure of their game manifests, in this case please let the developers of SRM know and we will resolve the issue.

## Compatibility
This parser works on `Windows`, `Linux`, and `Mac OS`. It would probably run just fine on your toaster if your toaster has an `installed.json` file somewhere.
