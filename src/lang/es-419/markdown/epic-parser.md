# Epic Games Parser

.

If it doesn't work it is because Epic has altered the structure of their game manifests, in this case please let the developers of SRM know and we will resolve the issue.

In order for this parser to work with the open source Epic alternative [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary), [EGL sync must be enabled in Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/discussions/276#discussioncomment-709748) (this creates the appropriate files for the parser to read, and does not require the `Epic Games Store` to be installed).

That said, there is also a `Legendary` parser in SRM which works right out of the box.

## Compatibilidad
Actualmente, este analizador funciona solamente en sistemas `Windows` y `Mac OS`. En `Mac OS` no es posible ejecutar desde la Epic Store, por lo que la opción debe permanecer deshabilitada.
