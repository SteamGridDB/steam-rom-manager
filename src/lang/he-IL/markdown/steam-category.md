# Steam category (optional) `[supports variables]`{.noWrap}

Also known as "tags", can be used to group apps in Steam. In order to set Steam category, the following syntax must be used:
```
${...}
```
For example, this is how you specify categories for "WII" and "GBA" (paired with "ROMS") category:
```
${WII}
```
```
${GBA}${ROMS}
```
This how "WII" category will look like in Steam:

## Emojis and non-Standard Unicode Characters
Please not that this field works just fine with emojis like `ðŸŽ®` work just fine in category names.
