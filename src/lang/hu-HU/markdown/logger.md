Submitting a report will upload:

- Your entire SRM configuration (parsers, exceptions, etc).
- The contents of the `Event Log`.
- The Steam VDF files that SRM modifies `[Optional]`.

After submitting a report you can:

- View the report by entering the `Report ID` into the [Logs Server](https://logs.jozen.blue).
- DM the `Report ID` to person helping you on the [SRM Discord](https://discord.gg/bnSVJrz).
- Delete the report from the [Logs Server](https://logs.jozen.blue) by entering the `Delete Key` instead.

_Anyone with the `Report ID` has full access to your issue report and its attached data!_
