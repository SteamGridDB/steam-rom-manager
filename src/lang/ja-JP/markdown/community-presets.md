# Community Presets

These are parser configurations that have been created by the SRM community and just need to be altered slightly with a few system specific parameters in order to work (usually just `ROMs Directory` and `Executable` need to be specified).

## Generic Parser

The Generic Parser (search `Generic` in presets) works for a wide variety of emulators that don't need specific commandline arguments in order to work, for example:

- Yuzu
- Citra
- Xenia (add `--fullscreen` in `Command Line Arguments` if desired)

If you have an emulator that isn't in the list of community presets, it is probably worth a shot to try the generic parser. If it works let us know and we will add a preset for it!
