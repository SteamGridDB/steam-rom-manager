# Steam parser

This parser imports steam games into SRM. It does not add shortcuts, but it allows you to set the artwork for your steam games. By default the parser will get games from all user accounts in the steam directory specified &mdash; if you would prefer to only get the games for a subset of the accounts then specify them in the `User accounts` field.

## Limitations
Unfortunately for the time being this parser only works for steam games **that are in at least one category**. The reason for this is that Steam only stores your full list of games locally if they are categorized. Sometimes, for unknown reasons, games will be stored locally regardless and the parser will work, but to be safe the easiest thing to do is just **create a Steam Category** that has all of your Steam games in it.

## User accounts (Optional)

Can be used to limit configuration to specific user accounts. In order to set user accounts, the following syntax must be used:
```
${...}
```
You **must** use the username you use to **log in** into Steam **if** [use account credentials](#what-does-use-account-credentials-do) is enabled:

![Account example](../../../assets/images/user-account-example.png) {.fitImage.center}

For example, this is how you specify account for "Banana" and "Apple":

```
${Banana}${Apple}
```

In case the [use account credentials](#what-does-use-account-credentials-do) is disabled, you can still limit accounts by specifying their ids directly:

```
${56489124}${21987424}
```

## What does "Skip found accounts with missing data directories" do?

Sometimes Steam's file that contains logins, may contain users that do not have data directory created (might have been manually deleted, etc.). You can specify to skip those accounts by enabling this option.

## What does "Use account credentials" do?

Tries to look for account credentials in Steam directory. In other words -- username. Username then can be used to filter accounts without actually having to know their ids.

### Warning!

If Steam has credential saving disabled, this option will prevent finding user accounts.
