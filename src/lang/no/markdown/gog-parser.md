# GOG Galaxy Parser

This parser imports games from `GOG Galaxy` so that artwork can be chosen for them and they can be added into Steam. If it doesn't work it is because GOG Galaxy has altered the structure of their game database, in this case please let the developers of SRM know and we will resolve the issue.

## Compatibility

This parser is currently functional on `Windows` systems only.
