# Glob Parser specific inputs

## User's glob

This is where you create your glob for extracting title from file path. Please read all of [special glob characters](#special-glob-characters) if you don't know how to construct a glob.

## How does it work?

In addition to special glob characters, glob parser requires you to enter `${title}`{.noWrap} variable. Parser will locate it's position inside your  **glob**, for example:

| User's glob            | Położenie                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `${title}/*/*.txt`     | First level from the left   |
| `{*,*/*}/${title}.txt` | First level from the right  |
| `**/${title}/*.txt`    | Second level from the right |

After acquiring `${title}`{.noWrap} position, `${title}`{.noWrap} will be replaced with a wildcard `*`.

## Ograniczenia

Position extraction comes with some limitations -- glob is invalid if position can not be extracted. Most of the time you will be warned about what you can't do, however, if you find a combination that is allowed, but produces incorrect titles please make an issue at [github](https://github.com/FrogTheFrog/steam-rom-manager/issues).
