# Steam Parser specific inputs

## Find artwork for games only
If enabled SRM will filter out any Steam applications that are not full games, such as demos and tools like `3DMark` or `Wallpaper Engine`.

## Find artwork for installed titles only
If enabled SRM will filter out any steam applications that are not currently installed locally. If you install or uninstall a game, you need to restart Steam before the updated install list will be available to SRM.
