This field is used to limit SRM's effects to specific user accounts. It can be set to `Global` or over ridden per parser.

## Varning

If you have `Don't save account credentials on this computer` set in Steam, then there is no way for SRM to know your `Steam Username` and `Choose Accounts` will only be able to pull your `Steam IDs`. If you would like to use `Steam Usernames` here, go to `Steam > Settings > Settings` and disable `Don't save account credentials on this computer`, then restart both Steam and SRM.
