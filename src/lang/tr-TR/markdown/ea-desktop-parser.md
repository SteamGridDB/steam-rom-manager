# EA Desktop Parser

This parser imports games from the `EA Desktop` app, so that artwork can be chosen for them and they can be added into Steam. If it doesn't work it is because EA has altered the structure of their xml files, in which case please let the developers of SRM know and we will resolve the issue.
