# Unique inputs for itch.io Parser

## itch.io AppData Path Override
By default Steam ROM Manager assumes your itch.io app data is located at `%APPDATA%\itch` on windows `$HOME/.config/itch` on linux and `$HOME/Library/Application Support/itch` on macos. This field allows you to override that path if your itch.io user data is elsewhere.
