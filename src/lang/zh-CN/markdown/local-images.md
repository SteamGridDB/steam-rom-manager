允许使用本地存储的图像。 A [special glob input](#special-glob-input) string is used to retrieve images, so for example you might do `/path/to/heroes/${title}.@(png|jpg)`. Backslashes can be used to escape characters, so that if your images live in `artwork [portraits]` you might do `/path/to/artwork \[portraits\]/${title}.@(png|jpg)`. A good idea is to set your artwork directory globally and then use the `${localimages}` dir environment variable in this field: `${localimagesdir}/emuname/heroes/${title}.@(png|jpg)` for example.
