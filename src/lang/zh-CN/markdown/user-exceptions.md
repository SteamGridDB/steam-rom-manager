This tool can be used to define per app exceptions that over rule the parsers. It should not be used to accomplish bulk tasks. For example, removing the colon character from titles can be accomplished via the title modifier `${/:/|${title}|}` and should not be done here. If a command line argument is common to every parsed app, then use the command line argument field - do not create a bunch of entries here! It should not be used to accomplish bulk tasks. For example, removing the colon character from titles can be accomplished via the title modifier `${/:/|${title}|}` and should not be done here. If a command line argument is common to every parsed app, then use the command line argument field - do not create a bunch of entries here! 它不应该用于完成批量任务。 例如，从标题中删除冒号字符可以通过标题修改器`${/:/|${title}|}`实现，不应在此处执行。 如果一个命令行参数适用于每个解析的应用程序，请使用命令行参数字段 - 不要在此处创建一堆条目！
