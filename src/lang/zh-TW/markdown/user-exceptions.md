# User Exceptions
## What not to use this for
This tool can be used to define per app exceptions that over rule the parsers. It should not be used to accomplish bulk tasks. For example, removing the colon character from titles can be accomplished via the title modifier `${/:/|${title}|}` and should not be done here. If a command line argument is common to every parsed app, then use the command line argument field - do not create a bunch of entries here! It should not be used to accomplish bulk tasks. For example, removing the colon character from titles can be accomplished via the title modifier `${/:/|${title}|}` and should not be done here.

The `Extracted Title` field matches in two ways:

* Based on the `Exception ID` (found by running test parser). Based on the `Exception ID` (found by running test parser). For example if the game were `Portal 1` and its `Exception ID` was `12345` then you might put `Portal 1 ${id:12345}`. Based on the `Exception ID` (found by running test parser). For example if the game were `Portal 1` and its `Exception ID` was `12345` then you might put `Portal 1 ${id:12345}`. If the `Exception ID` is present then it doesn't matter what label you put in front of it, but for readability and searchability it's nice to put the game's actual name in front of the `Exception ID`.

Thus you can either have an exception that applies to all games with the same name or an exception that applies only to an exact game (`Exception ID`s are unique). The reason for this is primarily backwards compatibility -- SRM formerly matched only on the `Extracted Title`.
